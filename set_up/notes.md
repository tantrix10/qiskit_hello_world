first thing we note about the plain matrix is that is is full rank
array([ 0.30554645, -0.07734645,  0.13222903, -0.02547403,  0.11785489,
       -0.00838349, -0.00164721,  0.02288315,  0.03950265,  0.09401883,
        0.08654232,  0.07738961,  0.05363481,  0.0625    ,  0.05824942,
        0.0625    ])

 We could try and do some very clever environment engineering in order to try and generate this eigendecomposition and then we can tweak around with the unitaries. Or we can see how close we can get with pure states!
